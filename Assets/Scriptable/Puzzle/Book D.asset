  FirstPage: "In the (grand) halls of the Elysium, where kindred gathered under the
    5 ancient banners of the Camarilla, whispers of an unsettling prophecy spread
    like wildfire. It was said that deep beneath the city, in the forgotten catacombs
    where the veins of the earth met, a dark ritual had been performed. The Malkavian
    seer, known for her cryptic visions, foretold of a looming threat from the EAST
    \u2014 a coterie of Tremere magi who sought to awaken an ancient power.\r\nAmidst
    the political intrigue and fragile alliances, whispers turned to murmurs of suspicion.
    The Prince, a cunning Ventrue, convened an emergency conclave to address the
    escalating tension. As night fell and the moon rose high in the sky, the fate
    of the city hung in the balance. \n\nAAn Extract taken from \"Past Stories\"
    from an unknown author\r\n"
