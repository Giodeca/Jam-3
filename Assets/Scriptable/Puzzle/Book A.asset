  FirstPage: '"Humans originally had four (arms), four legs, and a single head made
    of 2 faces. They could walk UPright, but they also could roll over and move quickly
    by spinning around on all eight limbs, like acrobats. These original humans were
    powerful and unruly, which caused Zeus to fear their strength. To weaken them
    and curb their insolence, he decided to split them in half, creating two separate
    beings. Each half, longing for its other half, would be less likely to threaten
    the gods and more likely to focus on finding and loving their missing piece.
