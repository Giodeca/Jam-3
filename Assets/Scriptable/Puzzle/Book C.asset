  FirstPage: '"Nevertheless, the (TRUTH) of the matter is that when you arm them,
    these mercenaries will not be loyal to you, and when they face the enemy, they
    will be quick to desert. Thus, a wise prince will always avoid them, and instead,
    he will prefer to rely on his own subjects or loyal allies. If a prince finds
    himself in the nort-WEST of Italy, for instance, where the inclination of the
    people is toward warfare, he would do well to organize his own forces, ensuring
    they are well-trained and loyal.

    If you look at the present state of affairs
    in Italy, you will see how the decline of military prowess has led to the fall
    of many states. To avoid such a fate, a prince must not only understand the art
    of war but also know how to inspire his subjects to follow him faithfully. By
    doing so, he will be able to maintain control over his state and ensure its prosperity.
    Therefore, the truth remains that only 1 of those princes who arm themselves
    with wisdom and their own troops can stand strong in the face of adversity."
