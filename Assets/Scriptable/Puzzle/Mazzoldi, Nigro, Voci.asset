  FirstPage: "**Auspex**\r\n\r\nAuspex is a Tremere discipline also owned by other
    Cainite clans, such as Malkavian and Toreador\r\n\r\nIt has multiple functions,
    most of which are useful in an investigation context. \r\n\r\nActivating the
    discipline allows the Cainite to spot hidden objects or creatures, read particular
    notes, and interact with objects trying to understand their past usage. \r\n\r\nAuspex
    is one of the most useful Cainite disciplines. There are no details which can
    remain a mystery to their owners.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Dominate**\r\n\r\nDominate is
    a Tremere discipline also owned by other Cainite clans, such as Malkavian and
    Ventrue\r\n\r\nIt has multiple functions, most of which are useful in many social
    contexts.\r\nIt is mainly used to force people to do actions, reveal information
    even modify their memory. \r\n\r\nDominate is a terrifying discipline if owned
    by a powerful vampire. \r\nVenture are well known for their mastery in this discipline\u2026
    \r\nProbably that\u2019s the reason why they have such influence in the Camarilla\r\n"
  SecondPage: "**Blood Sorcery**\r\n\r\nBlood Sorcery is a unique Tremere discipline
    owned by Tremeres. \r\n\r\nThis particular discipline doesn\u2019t provide just
    powerful Cainite abilities but gives access to the owner to a real deck of sorceries.\r\n\r\nNovice
    sorceries are not particularly effective, even if they are really useful, such
    as the \u201Ctaste for blood Sorcery\u201D which allows the Cainite to understand
    private and secret information by drinking other vampire blood. \r\n\r\nThe blood-warding
    circles are also powerful sorceries that provide protection and crowd control\r\n"
