    - "Now everything has become clear! \r\n\r\nThanks to the file organizer it is
      simple to understand Anna Lucciobelli\u2019s role in this elaborate plot.\r\n"
    - "The woman was an archaeologist, she was studying something related to the
      investigation made by Filippo. That\u2019s why he went to ask her for information.
      \r\n\r\nBut Anna was working for Vyce, as she was his Ghoul, then Vyce too
      is involved in the case in a deep way.\r\n"
    - "- Gran Madre Dio Arms Tien Vero - What does it means? \r\nI have collected
      files and notes about a mysterious place, seems like an old cave or\u2026 temple?
      \r\n"
    - "The vatican is involved for sure: there are many references to the Christianity
      religion, statues and relics\u2026 \r\n"
    - "Maybe Filippo is searching for clues at the Gran Madre, but this is not explaining
      why he is not contacting Machiavelli anymore\u2026 No. Something must have
      happened to him. I need to go to the Gran Madre, i\u2019m sure Filippo got
      some information by Anna Himself. \r\n\rI need to move, there\u2019s no time
      to waste\r\n"
