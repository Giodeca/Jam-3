    - So? What they were saying?
  - text:
    - 'Thank you, Martina. Now it is the time to forget what happened.

      Nothing
      has happened, you just drank too much, then the bathroom door was closed because
      was out of service.

    - "It was about 10:00 p.m.\r\nI was drinking with Carlotta and Luca. Then we
      sat near the bathroom\u2026.\r\n"
    - "I saw a woman running into the bathroom, she seemed afraid of something or
      someone, so she shut the door and stayed there for 30 min. \r\n\r\n"
    - I had to pee, so I waited, but after 15 minutes, I really had to pee.. So I
      went to the bathroom door. But it was closed.
    - "Before arriving near the door I could barely hear my friend\u2019s voice because
      the music was too loud, but once I got near the door, I started hearing some
      voices coming from the bathroom. "
  - text:
    - 'I could barely understand those. Then I started knocking on the door, asking
      if everything was fine, then I heard the voices stop. '
    - "Then suddenly I heard something. \r\nNo. Someone growled, and a mirror got
      broken, the woman started screaming, she seemed in pain, and then silence\r\n"
