    - "Let\u2019s analyze what I've understood\u2026 "
    - "The Gangrel I\u2019m looking for has brutally murdered a brother\u2019s ghoul\u2026"
    - "By my sorcery rituals, the result indicates the Victim\u2019s name was Anna
      Lucciobelli, and her Sire\u2019s name was Achille Fiore, also known as Vyce
      Miloriedavach. \nI have already heard about this surname, the Miloriedavach
      family is well known in the Mafia hierarchy. \r\n\r\n"
    - "Since the blood sorcery has revealed that the victim used two main disciplines:
      celerity and presence\u2026  and according to the Nightclub environment, and
      the identity of the Sire\u2026"
    - "We can affirm that Mr Milorievadach is a Bruja clan member. \r\nDefinitely
      an important one if he could afford the resources to inscribe a Tremere warding
      circle in the Bathroom. \r\n"
    - "Thinking about the homicide dynamic instead, Miss Lucciobelli already knew
      about the Gangrel's true nature, probably that wasn\u2019t their first encounter\u2026\r\nThat\u2019s
      why she brought in the bathroom a holy water bottle\u2026\r\n"
    - "She thought she was safe in the room with the Warding circle, but the Gangrel
      hadn't taken the door\u2026 he passed through using his mist instead.\r\nThat
      explains why the holy water has not being used, and why she got murdered so
      easily\u2026 \r\n"
    - "But for which reason Filippo went here, to speak to a bruja\u2019s ghoul\u2026
      \r\nWhy is miss Lucciobelli so important? What\u2019s her relationship with
      the Vatican? \r\n"
    - 'I must investigate about this Vyce Miloriedavach if i want to understand clearly
      what happened

'
    - "But for which reason Filippo went here, to speak to a bruja\u2019s ghoul\u2026
      \r\nWhy is miss Lucciobelli so important? What\u2019s her relationship with
      the Vatican? \r\n"
